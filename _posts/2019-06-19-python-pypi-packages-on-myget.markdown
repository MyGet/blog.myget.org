We are excited to announce that Python PyPI package repositories are now available on MyGet! 

Our team has been hard at work implementing our most requested new packaging format and is excited to support the growing community of Python developers with a secure, easy-to-use platform for their public or private Python package repositories.

With this initial release of Python compatibility, our primary goal has been to provide Python-based development teams with the core features already available for NuGet, Maven, Bower, npm, PHP Composer, and VSIX feeds on MyGet. MyGet PyPI package repositories comply with modern Python standards, integrate with your existing development ecosystem, and streamline the secure distribution of your Python modules without having to configure and deploy your own PyPI server.

## What features are available?

With PyPI package support on MyGet, you can:

* Create public or private feeds to upload Python modules, libraries and binaries in the Python Wheel package format.
* Mirror or cache upstream packages from the [public Python package index](https://pypi.org).
* Use granular access controls to provide the appropriate set of permissions to specific teammates and end users who need to consume or contribute to your feed.
* Scan your Python packages for known security vulnerabilities, dependencies and license compliance.
* Install MyGet Python packages in your local environment using PIP.
* Provide your team with a single URL to install application dependencies and shared components for Python.

## How do I get started?

For more detailed information about setting up PyPI package feeds in your MyGet account, feel free to check out the [Python package walkthrough in our documentation center](https://docs.myget.org/docs/walkthrough/getting-started-with-python).
