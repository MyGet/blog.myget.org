**Today we are thrilled to announce that MyGet has been acquired by Assembla.** 

We started MyGet in 2011 with the goal of providing the market a package-management service that truly stood out above the others. 

In that time, and with the help of our amazing customers, we were able to grow MyGet to 40,000 users. This has been in no small way related to the success our clients have had in their business pursuits.

While we’ve enjoyed the ride, it’s time for us to start something new. Earlier this year, we were introduced to the team at Assembla, and in our discussions with them, we realized that Assembla is the perfect home for MyGet. 

**Why we made this decision**

Making the decision to partner with Assembla and ultimately have them acquire MyGet was not easy, but it made sense. It is always difficult to let go of something you built from the ground up. But at the end of the day, we knew that Assembla would be able to provide MyGet and our customers with resources to take their code and businesses to the next level.Assembla has the knowledge and experience to run a Software-as-a-Service, and having developer tools experience themselves, we know that this will benefit MyGet customers.

**Resources and knowledge share**

Assembla is part of the Scaleworks family, a venture equity fund dedicated to acquiring and growing B2B, SaaS, cloud-based businesses. We know that as part of the Scaleworks family, MyGet will have access to a knowledge share it otherwise wouldn’t, and that we truly believe will serve our customer base well. 

**Security first**

One of the primary reasons we decided to go with [Assembla](https://www.assembla.com/home?utm_medium=Blog&utm_source=Myget-site&utm_campaign=18-MyGet-Founder-Blog&lt=Trial&ltd=webpage-Homepage-MyGet-Founder) is because of their security-first mind-set.  With a source code management tool built for the enterprise and a focus on shifting security to the left, we know that our customers will be in good hands. 

**What it means for our customers**

For our current customers, we want to communicate that no action will be needed on your part. You will be receiving communication from the Assembla team regarding updates to the support channel, but you will not be required to do anything. Should you have any issues, please reach out to support at [support@myget.org](mailto:support@myget.org).

We are excited to see the growth that this acquisition will bring for MyGet and our customers. 

Stay tuned for what’s to come!
