We are excited to announce that MyGet.org, the login page, and the app will be getting an updated look and feel by the end of this week! 

Nothing in the app will move and all functionality will remain the same. You’ll simply see some color and styling changes to the app and website.

To give you a sneak peek of of what you’ll be seeing, we’ve put together some preview shots.

We look forward to sharing the newly designed MyGet experience with you very soon. Feel free to send questions to [support@myget.org](mailto:support@myget.org).
