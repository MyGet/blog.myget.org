# A Product Survey Story: What we learned üßê 


A little while back we invited the MyGet community to participate in our first annual product survey! We wanted to learn more about you, our customers,and about how you have been using MyGet to push, pull, and manage your packages.

While we learned a tremendous amount about what value most about MyGet and what we need to change, we‚Äôve been more eager to share the results with you to help us all better understand the community that makes up MyGet! Here are our top takeaways from the results.


## Built by developers, for developers

First off, we learned more about you! As we think about continuing to build out the functionality of MyGet, it's so important to understand who actually uses our platform and what challenges you face. (Especially in a world that is growing more and more remote, it‚Äôs important to stay connected as a community!)

Of the more than 750 folks that participated, more than 85% of you self-identified as having a technical role on your team, whether that be as a developer/software engineer (58%), architect (12%), DevOps/IT engineer (12%) or a Tester/QA team member (3%).

## .NET, JavaScript HTML: The Top 3
In its early days, MyGet was jokingly called ‚ÄúNuGet-as-a-service‚Äù. That was the need it was built to solve. So, it‚Äôs not surprising to see Microsoft .NET frameworks continuing to be the languages used the most by MyGet community members.

What _**IS**_  interesting is the percent of Python users that have joined. Python developers represent the largest percentage of the MyGet community outside of .NET, JavaScript and plain HTML/CSS, outdoing Java developers by 2%. We‚Äôre no longer just a NuGet family; the MyGet tent has grown and some of you have spread your programming wings. üò≠

On one hand, it might be expected to see a fair number of responses from Python developers in our survey results, given Python‚Äôs the ever-growing populatiry. (According to [RedMonk Programming Language Rankings](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/02/28/language-rankings-1-20/) Python has climbed into the number two spot in terms of most widely-used programming languages.)

But on the other hand, our Python integration was one of the most recent functionalities we added to MyGet. It‚Äôs reassuring to see the number of folks in the MyGet community who might now be able to store their Python modules and libraries in MyGet alongside the other packages they already use..   In less than six months, Python PyPI packages climbed to the number 5 spot in our list of most-used package formats on MyGet, surpassing a number of other package manager types that have been supported by MyGet for years and knocking on Maven‚Äôs doorstep for the number 4 spot.

## How does MyGet fit into your SDLC?  

Over 98% of you responded that you are currently using source control for the proprietary code you write, which is a good thing: source control is a must-have for modern software development. Almost 100% of you who use source control are using Git,  with your top three favorite hosting platforms beingGithub, Azure DevOps (split between cloud and server), and Bitbucket. \

One of the most effective ways to leverage the artifacts you store in MyGet is to integrate MyGet with your CI/CD processes. More than 85% of you responded that you have already embraced the continuous delivery and integration, using a myriad of tools such as Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and TeamCity to run your builds.

## Why do you use MyGet?

Because of its nature as a hub between multiple spokes of the SDLC, the number of different use cases for MyGet can be quite varied. However, over 68% you reported using MyGet to share your private packages within your internal team.  That is followed by the next three use cases which each had about the same number of responses:  23% of you used MyGet to storing build artifacts, 21% responded that you use MyGet to  control the open source packages used in your dev environment,  followed closely by the 20% of you using MyGet to host open-source packages you have built and shared with the community/public.

## What did you ask us to prioritize next?

 \
MyGet‚Äôs success depends on our ability to continue improving features and building new ones that make your lives easier and help you ship better products. Despite the rise and adoption of 3rd-party CI/CD platforms across the MyGet Community, more than 75% of you said that updating MyGet‚Äôs build services to support .NET Core 3 and C# 8 was important to you. Improving uptime and availability, your second-most requested improvement, has been high on our priority list for a while as well, so we are glad to see that this aligns with the concerns you have. While we most likely will not be able to deliver all of the features you‚Äôve requested this year, your feedback has been enormously helpful as we‚Äôve been culling down our roadmap for the next fiscal year starting in April. Thank you again for your candid input‚Äîwe are going to be able to be much more focused on delivering the improvements important to you because of it!
